"SY 25-26 High School Science Teacher","New York City Metropolitan Area","2025-06-04","MESA Charter High School","Math, Engineering, and Science Academy (MESA) Charter High School is a community high school in Bushwick, Brooklyn. We opened our doors in August 2013 and we now have 498 students in grades 9-12. We graduated our first class of seniors in June 2017 and our cumulative graduation rate is 94%. Our students come from more than forty different middle schools, including traditional public, parochial, and public charter schools. Some are advanced students coming from magnet schools; others are beginning English Language Learners. What they all have in common is a desire to succeed; MESA students come to school every day, ready to work.




As an organization, MESA is entering a new phase. Based on its success, MESA is proud to be entrusted with opening a second school in District 20. Serving the diverse families of Borough Park, Bay Ridge, Bensonhurst, Sunset Park, and Dyker Heights, MESA 2 will be the first public 9-12 school built in the area in over 80 years.




We are welcoming 125 9th graders in August of 2025 and will ""grow up"" with them by adding subsequent grades each year. We need rockstar teachers to join our current Bushwick campus as well as to launch our South Brooklyn campus, and are hiring in all content areas, with a preference to those who want to found a school and humbly serve this community for years to come.




What makes us different is our staff. This year, 42% of staff will be in at least their fifth year at MESA! MESA teachers believe…

 * that the greatest contribution we can make to social justice is to give a young person control of their destiny
 * committed people, when given autonomy, will find innovative and creative ways to make change
 * that being a great educator takes intellectual preparation and a strong sense of personal accountability to produce high quality work.




What makes us different is our model:

 * Intentional Grading—MESA uses a standards-based grading system, which makes data understandable and accessible. This enables teachers to create targeted, focused instruction, and helps students understand and track their own progress. MESA teachers love data or at the very least, aren’t afraid of it!
 * Intentional Support—MESA teachers have a minimum of rote administrative duties in order to better focus on planning and instruction. Teachers receive ongoing coaching while dedicated time for co-teaching, department and grade team planning are built into the school schedule.
 * Intentional Professional Development—MESA has a comprehensive professional development calendar that includes sessions on instructional practices, school culture as well as diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.
 * Intentional School Culture—MESA’s advisory model connects small groups of entering freshmen with a teacher-advisor for all 4 years of high school. Advisors provide guidance on academic progress and are mentors, facilitators and positive influencers. Students are recognized by their teachers regularly for academic achievement and effort and are incentivized to meet school expectations around attendance, punctuality and preparedness.
 * Intentional Relationships—MESA knows that all caregivers want their children to succeed. MESA enlists families as partners in their child’s education through regular communication, workshops, and access to student attendance information and grades. More than 85% of MESA caregivers attend the initial parent-teacher conference of the school year.
 * Intentional Scheduling—MESA’s school day starts and ends later than most DOE schools, as research indicates that a late start helps high-school students succeed. The calendar and earlier start allows for “Intersession,” during Spring Break where students receive enrichment, skill remediation, or Regents preparation.




Job Responsibilities

 * Design and teach five periods each day (two periods daily of prep time). Utilize Universal Design for Learning method of planning and instruction to reach all learners.
 * Build relationships with all students. MESA teachers believe that strong rapport is key to student engagement and motivation.
 * Attend, participate in, and facilitate team meetings and professional development opportunities, as well as common planning times. MESA believes that good professional development is interactive, practical, and teacher-driven.
 * Communicate regularly with caregivers about both positive and negative interactions with students, making a minimum of two positive contacts (phone, email, or text message) with families per week.
 * Hold office hours before or after school, at least once per week, to provide extra help and opportunities for reassessment.
 * Teach one week of Intersession enrichment program based on teacher interest (additional stipend provided).
 * Maintain duties as Advisor.
 * Other duties, as assigned by the Principal.

Overview

Broome Street Academy Charter High School (BSA) is a tuition-free public charter high school located in SoHo, educating students from all five boroughs, and devoted to providing students the necessary skills and support to graduate prepared for a successful future beyond high school. Our equitable, holistic, and student-centered approach will provide students with access to a rigorous, standards-based curriculum that will equip our graduates with the skills they need to make a positive impact on their communities and the broader world.

Our partnership allows us to serve the whole student and meet a variety of non-academic needs that clear the path for student learning.

Our teachers are encouraged to let their voices be heard, and to not be okay with the status quo in education. They meet students where they are academically, and socio-emotionally, push them forward when they need just a little nudge, or lift them up when more is necessary. Student achievement is the north star for a teacher at BSA, and they know that success can look different for every student.

Notre Dame de Sion is an independent Catholic and interfaith high school in Kansas City, serving approximately 320 students. Sion empowers young women to discover their purpose, grow in confidence, and use their gifts to shape a more just and compassionate world. Inspired by the legacy of the Sisters of Sion, our school community is grounded in the values of love, respect, openness, connection, and hope.

Sion blends a strong college preparatory curriculum with innovative, experiential learning that engages students in real-world problem solving and meaningful community partnerships. With intentionally small class sizes and a deep commitment to relationship-based teaching, faculty are able to know each student and support their growth—intellectually, socially, and spiritually.

Educators at Sion are part of a dynamic, mission-driven team. They collaborate across disciplines, contribute to a vibrant extracurricular program, and help shape a culture where belonging, curiosity, and reflection are central to student success. Sion is a place where faculty feel the impact of their work and the joy of guiding young women as they become faith-filled global citizens and servant leaders.

About The Position

The high school chemistry instructor teaches five sections, including introductory, honors, and AP-level courses, with an average class size of 15–22 students. As a member of a four-person science department, the instructor collaborates with colleagues across disciplines to create rich, inquiry-based learning experiences that reflect Sion’s commitment to academic excellence and student-centered learning.

Sion’s recently renovated chemistry lab, completed just two years ago, offers a modern, well-equipped environment for hands-on experimentation and collaborative projects. In addition to the lab, science faculty have access to shared office space and a prep room to support instructional planning and collaboration.

Sion educators thrive in a supportive environment that values innovation, reflection, and relationships. Teachers are encouraged to design engaging, experiential learning opportunities and to contribute to a dynamic academic culture that empowers young women to lead with purpose and confidence.

Sion Educators Are

Confident Practitioners: they know their subject and the instructional techniques to help students meet educational goals.

Growth-Minded Learners: they understand that knowledge is not finite - students and teachers can grow, learn new things, and accomplish tasks they never knew were possible.

Mindful Communicators: they communicate in a way that is solution-focused, timely, and positive. This includes verbal, written, and non-verbal communication.

Collaborative Team Players: they pitch in and help with events outside their classroom to make Sion a place that is rich in community and models servant leadership.

Inclusive Community Builders: they use language and actions that are never destructive of egos. They ensure that students and other faculty members feel a sense of belonging at Sion.

GeneticsCourse Description:

In Gene to Genome, students will learn the fundamentals of genetics, centering on the transfer of information through the Central Dogma of Biology (DNA→ RNA→ Protein). Specifically, students will focus on heritable diseases and the mechanisms by which they are inherited. The course begins at the molecular level and zooms out to organismal inheritance and genomic studies.

The course will culminate with a presentation at our very own EU Genetics Conference! Students will take on the role of researchers presenting on a heritable disease to their peers and families, who will take on the role of colleagues in the field.

Our courses are interactive, use videos and images, and, most importantly, include hands-on activities such as building model systems using candy and household items, extracting strawberry DNA and observing it under microscopes the students build, and engaging in lab activities and demos in order to explore both the molecular and organismal aspects of inheritance.

Campers will explore careers in genetics on Thursday and see what the praxis of our studies looks like in the professional world. The culminating project will be a presentation to peers and parents on the heritable disease that students have researched as we explore each aspect of our curriculum.

Cardiology Course Description:

Scientists will uncover the complexities of the cardiovascular system through a wealth of interactive and inquiry-based experiments, and project-based, hands-on activities. The Cardiology program offers your budding scientists the opportunity to deepen their understanding of body systems. It is the perfect bridge between our Anatomy and Physiology course, and prior to enrolling in Neuroanatomy.

Young scientists will explore how the function and structure of the heart impact blood circulation and nutrient transport. In addition, scientists will study the impact of disease on the cardiovascular system. Scientists will have the opportunity to create models detailing anatomy, engineer a heart, and make connections to other body systems that will inspire them to want to investigate more!

In addition, scientists will participate in truly hands-on activities, such as sheep and cow heart dissections!

Anatomy/Physiology Course Description: (1 session available)

Anatomy and Physiology scientists will be dissecting the wonders of the human body. In this camp, we will zoom into multiple body systems using interactive and kinesthetic laboratory explorations.

Who is this camp for? Budding physicians and kids fascinated by health and the human in late-elementary or early middle school that want a fun, hands-on first experience with anatomy, physiology, and kinesiology.

Throughout the week, scientists will have opportunities to wonder, lead, and explore their curiosities of the human body. Scientists will begin the week investigating the curvy, mushy, and aromatic digestive system. Understanding how the human body obtains the nutrients required for survival will provide the scientist with a foundation to explore the skeletal, muscular, and nervous systems. Using our bodies and creating models, we will discover how muscles function with the skeleton to make our bodies move and how the systems respond to injuries. Comparative anatomy explorations through the dissection of fetal pigs and cow eyes will provide scientists the opportunity to dig deeper into the relationship between the body systems. Scientists will investigate the nervous system through the five senses and the tricks they can play on us. We will manipulate our taste buds, sniff out smells, identify blind spots, and use touch to investigate the unknown. We will learn the basics of microscopy and view the systems explored on a cellular level.

Scientists will be designing unique Anatomy Doll Models that will highlight and apply what is learned in each system by incorporating personal details. Family and friends are invited to join us at the conclusion of the week for a showcase highlighting student explorations from the week.

Marine Science Course Description: (Positions filled for Marine Science)

Marine Science students will ""dive"" headfirst into one of the world’s least-explored places – the ocean! In this camp, we will take a multi-disciplinary approach to learning and incorporate studies in chemistry, oceanography, ecology, and marine biology to learn about Earth's amazing seas and the animals and plants that inhabit them.

Campers will begin their week by investigating water and discovering how its unique properties shape our oceans, currents, and biomes both under the sea and at the beach. We'll then shift into marine life and explore food webs and marine adaptations, paying special attention to survival strategies such as mimicry, camouflage, and bioluminescence. Later on in the week, we will take a closer look at the anatomy and physiology of ocean predators - campers will have the opportunity to dissect fish, squid, and sharks to compare their body structures and functions to their niches within the food chain.

We will round out our week by looking at humankind's impact on the ocean as a whole. Campers will engineer an environmental disaster in the form of an oil spill and then brainstorm methods to clean up both the water and the population of affected shorebirds. We will also study water pH, ocean acidification, and its effects on shell-based marine life.

Responsibilities

In-person Camp Responsibilities include teaching the Education Unlimitedcurriculum, supervising campers both in and out of the classroom, organizing and leading classroom labs, and executing a finale showcasing student work at the end of camp.Instructors will also be responsible for tracking student work and handing in any deliverables to the camp director and EU home office.
